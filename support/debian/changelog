uploadnewip (2.2.0-1) bionic; urgency=medium

  * Added 
  * -----
  * > -v|--version for displaying version information.
  * > Extended compatibilty across distros (Ubuntu, Debian, Raspbian, Fedora, CentOS, openSUSE (Leap & Tumbleweed).  

  * Changed
  * -------
  * > Debian package description.
  * > unitName replaces uniUnit, to avoid confusion and match closer with getnewip.  

  * Fixed:
  * > Correctly written bash instructions.
  * > Now properly removes one or multiple given unit(s).
  * > Permissions for units, to avoid errors -- In some distros users don't have groups of the same name.
  * > Now cleans up temporary http request remains better.
