  * Changed
  * -------
  * > Debian package description.
  * > unitName replaces uniUnit, to avoid confusion and match closer with getnewip.  

  * Fixed:
  * > Correctly written bash instructions.
  * > Now properly removes one or multiple given unit(s).
  * > Permissions for units, to avoid errors -- In some distros users don't have groups of the same name.
  * > Now cleans up temporary http request remains better.
